## Better Path - R-tree Nearest Neighbor
#### Due: 02-10-2022 (Thursday @ 9:30 a.m.)

# NOT DONE JUST A PREVIEW

Use R-Tree spatial index to find nearest neighbor cities to better complete our path. This is still a greedy solution and is not guaranteed optimal, however, I want to know the total distance saved as compared to visiting cities as sorted on the x-axis.
