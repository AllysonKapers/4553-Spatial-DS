### Fast Api Tutorial and Docs

- Remember that they run the api differently using `uvicorn` from the command line and we 
use `python filename.py` which invokes `uvicorn` from the `__main__` block inside the file.

### Requirements

- You can install the `requirements.txt` by running: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Remember that I decided to use Pythons `Vertualenv` instead of conda. So I think this command should work for anyone using `conda` as thier environment: `conda install --file requirements.txt`
